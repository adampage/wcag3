A visual and programmatically available mechanism exists that allows users to return to the :term[starting point] of the :term[conformance scope].

:::except-when
* The :term[page]/:term[view] is the starting point of the :term[conformance scope].
* It is essential to the functionality not to provide this mechanism.

Where the :term[conformance scope] is a sub-part of larger digital product, then the starting point should be the conformance scope starting point. For example, an organization's careers website that is separate from the main website.

A set of :term[Views] and/or :term[Pages] selected to be part of a conformance claim. Where a View or Page is part of a :term[Process], all the Views or Pages in the process must be included.

:::note
How a person or organization selects the set is not defined in WCAG3. There maybe informative guidance on selecting a suitable set in future (similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">WCAG-EM</a>), but regional laws or regulations may provide a methodology.
